            <h2>Website Creator: Pinpin, Miguel-Vernard</h2>
            <p>About me: I basically made this to share about my personal experiences while working out, things that will be shared are what I personally learned and what I learned online. This is to share what I know with others and possibly help them get past my plateau's. I have been working out since I was 17 but got serious at 18 and now I am 19. I know I am a beginner but I have lots of things I can share throughout my 2 years working out.</p>
