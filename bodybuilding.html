            <p class="bigger">NOW MY PERSONAL WITH GAINING MUSCLE
                I was able to gain muscle  efficiently because of many factors. Want to know what these factors are? Basically I would start off knowing what I would hit.
                PLANNING: There are many muscle groups so you would want to make a smart plan that you can follow with! An example is my split was PUSH/PULL/LEGS (also known as PPL) this split is good for people who have free time throughout there day to workout 6 days a week. 
                You may be a little confused because I said only 3 things, Push, Pull, and Legs so why did I say 6 days? That IS because you need to workout 2 times a week for each muscle group IN ORDER to grow MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF MUSCLE!
                Other factors such as how you workout matter! You can’t just have a plan and start pumping weights! You need to control slowly at the Eccentric part of workouts and EXPLODE at the Concentric part of the movement! 
                You NEED a range of 6-12 sets EVERY WEEK per muscle group, anything less is not much growth and too much is useless! 
                My last advice is to TRACK, write down what you worked out! SO, you can do a proper progressive overload! KNOWING you got stronger and stronger every week.

            <p class="bigger">I know I am no IFBB Pro (International Fitness and Bodybuilding Federation) but that doesn’t account for all I have experienced.
                Note: Genetics play a part for aesthetics and people with really good genetics may get farther than you, but that’s not an excuse to stop working out for your own health and longevity.
                This information accumulated after 2-3 years, I am still fairly new and willing to learn much more the years go by.
                Don’t let social media give you body dysmorphia.
