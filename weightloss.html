            <h2>YOU CHOSE: Weight Loss</h2>
            <p class="bigger">FOR LOSING WEIGHT
                With my own experience on this, one thing I noticed that worked was when I started doing lots of cardio! But don’t be fooled, you can’t just do tons of cardio and eat expecting to lose weight. What actually matters is your diet, it would be way easier cutting calories than doing the cardio to burn the weight.
                You can use diets, but calorie deficits are what make you lose the weight. 
                Calories IN Calories OUT
                To explain this further, you should eat a less than what your current maintenance calories. Example: I eat 2,500 daily cal so instead I decrease to 2,000 cal a day. This process would help me lose weight, if I can follow through with this, I will slowly but easily lose the weight.
                I also recommend eating very high proteins or vegetables as volume eating to reduce your hunger so you don’t eat unhealthier food and crave more. 
                Contrary to weight loss you can eat more than maintenance (IF YOU ARE WORKING OUT), it is considered a bulk and this helps build muscle faster than maintaining what you eat.
                Example: Eating 500+ calories to maintain a lean bulk. 
            </p>
            <p class="bigger">Lean Bulk: Healthy focused controlled eating, not going over calories.Dirty Bulk: Eating too much and gaining too much fat, having tons of fat.
                Caloric Deficit: You need to figure out your maintenance and lower it by a little. You need to find a maintainable deficit to not go back to old habits of eating bad.
                You can’t change without changes in your lifestyle
